# QuadTree Visualizer  
![Demo](./quadtree.gif)

## What I learned 
I learned how to implement a recursive data structure in C++, and develop an interactive visualization for that data structure. 
## Instructions
Click to add points. Each time a point is added, the QuadTree will be subdivided in order to enforce the `CAPACITY` requirement defined in quadtree.hpp. By default `CAPACITY = 1`.
